                1. If you all look forward to a bad day, please visit Dorabjee And Sons on first top most priority. Heard alot, soo went there out of respect for tradition and good food.
                2. The taste is amazing we had biryani and it was so fragrant at the same time light on the stomach. Along with that we also had Ardee's soda, which almost tasted like red bull but yeah... It was good. The prices are good, taste is awesome and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for authentic parsi food on a weekend afternoon. People are welcoming and the service is also good.
                3. Best place for iconic and authentic Irani food. It's not a place for vegetarians, there is a menu for sure but the meat tastes better. They have varieties of snacks and meals which compliment each other and even the authentic beverages which go well with the food. Cutlets are really good and scrumptious. To finish the meal, try the desserts.
                Recommended Dishes: Chicken Cutlet, Mutton Cutlet, Chicken Biryani Rice, Mutton Dhansak with Brown Rice, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Dhansak with Brown Rice, Lagan Nu Custard

                1. The food here is very tasty. There is also a good variety of South Indian dishes. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is lively.
                2. The only best place for south indian food in Pune. We had cheese onion uttapa, mysore masala dosa, masala dosa, cheese chilli toast, and coffee. The coffee is amazing something to die for.
                3. This place serves delicious South Indian food but is usually very crowded.... However... Wait is worth the money
